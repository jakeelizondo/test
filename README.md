## Summary

This application was developed as part of a coding challenge to solve the following problem: https://github.com/OneviewCommerce/typescript-react-redux-test, as well as for practice utilizing TypeScript, Redux, Jest, and React.

## Technologies Used

- Create-React-App - boilerplate setup for React, initiated for this application with npx create-react-app --template typescript
- React Hooks - this project is built using React Hooks and functional components as well as one class component
- CSS 3 - I chose to use vanilla CSS to style this form to show my capability to use CSS3, but am certainly open to using CSS in JS like styled components, or a preprocessor like SASS

## What I Learned

This project was a good learning experience for using CSS to conform to someone elses design. I also got a lot of practice specifically with using position:fixed to make the hovering select menu work. Really a lot of good practice with positioning in general.

## Core decisions for discussion

1. I chose to move the Drop Down into another isolated component, 1 to show that I can modularize components to make them more reusable, and 2 because after trying to get the drop down to work with select & option elements I realized that I was going to need to look for a more custom component solution in order to get it to look like the design.
